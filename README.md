# openresty-install
setup openresty to serve [https everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere)

I have recently moved to the [solus](https://solus-project.com/) operating system, so I have decided to rework my
openresty install procedure. My VPS server will remain on Ubuntu but my desktop for the forseeable will be Solus. 

##Objectives:
- Automate the install procedure as much as possible
